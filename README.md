# Text Rating Predictor

This project predicts ratings (e.g., Yelp stars) from text reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. It leverages text feature extraction techniques like **TF-IDF** and **Count Vectorizer** to transform text into numerical features, which are then used to train a predictive model.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Use TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer to convert text into numerical features.
- **Rating Prediction**: Train a machine learning model to predict ratings based on text input.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple scripts for training and predicting ratings.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-rating-predictor.git
   cd text-rating-predictor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. Predict ratings from text:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --text "Your review text here"
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Example `requirements.txt`:
```plaintext
numpy>=1.19.0
pandas>=1.2.0
scikit-learn>=0.24.0
nltk>=3.6.0
```

## Example

Input:
```bash
python predict.py --text "The food was amazing and the service was excellent!"
```

Output:
```
Predicted Rating: 5 stars
```
